# Covenant (Ice)

**Exploratory Research — Frozen / Untrained Model Governance**

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository explores **Covenant applied to untrained or frozen ("ice") AI models**.

Covenant (Ice) assumes:
- Models are untrained, minimally trained, or frozen
- No human feedback methods (e.g. RLHF) are used to shape behavior
- Governance and constraint structures precede or replace training

This repository is **research-first and exploratory**, not a production system.

---

## Core Question

Can governance, constraint, and legitimacy structures shape emergence **without** training signals or reward optimization?

This repo investigates whether Covenant-like structures can:
- Guide behavior before learning
- Avoid feedback-driven alignment pathologies (e.g. Sable-style problems)
- Preserve interpretability under extreme constraint

---

## What This Repo Is *Not*

This repository is **not**:
- A practical deployment system
- A trained-model wrapper
- A guarantee of alignment
- A finished architecture

## Status

This codebase is **highly experimental**. Many ideas may remain theoretical or be abandoned.

Disagreement, dead ends, and revision are expected and documented.
